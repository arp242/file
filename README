This is an UNOFFICIAL version of Nicholas Marriott's new privsep file(1)
implementation for OpenBSD (..introduced in 5.8); portability changes
were written by me, brynet@. General bug fixes should be reported to the
OpenBSD mailing lists and tested against the latest CVS version.

* Linux seccomp-bpf sandbox support derived from portable OpenSSH.

It has been lightly tested on Linux.

This project makes no attempt at coexisting with other file(1)
implementations. Take note before installing system wide.

Any bugs introduced in this porting effort are mine.
