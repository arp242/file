This is an UNOFFICIAL version of Nicholas Marriott's new privsep file(1)
implementation for OpenBSD (..introduced in 5.8); portability changes
were written by me, brynet@. General bug fixes should be reported to the
OpenBSD mailing lists and tested against the latest CVS version.

* Linux seccomp-bpf sandbox support derived from portable OpenSSH.

Quick/dirty build & install instructions for Linux (glibc):
	$ sudo useradd -r -s /usr/sbin/nologin _file
	$ ./configure && make && sudo make install
	$ sudo install -b -c -o root -g root -m 444 ./magic /etc/magic

This project makes no attempt at coexisting with other file(1)
implementations. Take note before installing system wide.

Any bugs introduced in this porting effort are mine.
