This is an UNOFFICIAL version of Nicholas Marriott's new privsep file(1)
implementation for OpenBSD (..to be introduced in 5.8); portability
changes were written by me, brynet@.

Any bugs introduced in this porting effort are mine.

It has been lightly tested on FreeBSD, Linux and, of course, OpenBSD.
